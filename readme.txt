== Description ==

The Options Framework Plugin makes it easy to include an options panel in any WordPress theme.  It was built so that theme developers can concentrate on making the actual theme rather than spending a ton of time on creating an options panel from scratch.  It's free to use in both commercial and personal projects, just like WordPress itself.

Please visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin) for a full description of how to define and use the theme options.

The code is heavily based on the [WooFramework](http://www.woothemes.com/) and their option styles.

== Installation ==

If your theme already has options enabled, they will show up under the apperance menu.

If your theme doesn't have options, you can define them to options.php of your theme and they will instantly show up.  For more on how to do this, visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I build options for my own theme? =

Download the development version from GitHub [https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-plugin](https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-plugin) and copy the "options-check" folder into your themes directory.

The "Options Check" theme is a blueprint for how to work with options.  It includes an example of every option available in the panel and sample output in the theme.

You can also watch the video screencast I have at [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).
